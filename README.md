Food Order App is app created in educational purposes. Technologies that i learned during codding it are:

- Function based react components
- React Hooks: useReducer, useState, useContext
- Provider
- Fragments
- ForwardRefs
- SCSS

Food Order App is a bit overcomplicated projects (compare to its real size) and contains a lot of fancy solutions.
